                Nobody spoke of an alleged mercenary hideout in the Mediterranean — most likely because they ended up captured or dead. But with recent intelligence, our Operators uncovered an ancient compound known as Fortune’s Keep, adjacent to a smuggler’s paradise complete with a medieval village by the sea, now seemingly a base of operations for the Konni Group PMC.
                
                 
                
                Developed by High Moon Studios, Fortune’s Keep is a newly redesigned map in Call of Duty®: Warzone™. Deep-dive into the details on every major point of interest (POI) within the map.

                get familiar with the smaller yet intricate design of the map so that you and your squadmates are prepared to take it by storm and rotate effectively.</p>
